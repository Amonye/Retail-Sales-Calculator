Accounting & Sales Management System (Python CLI Project)

Project Overview

This project is a Python-based Accounting Management System designed to track and manage daily business operations such as:

Shift sales (morning/evening)
Employee working hours
Salary calculations
Daily expenditures
Basic record searching and reporting
The system uses file-handling and data-processing techniques to store and retrieve structured business data.
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Python functions, CSV file management, user input handling, and basic data analysis using pandas.

 Key Features

- Record daily shift sales
- Store employee working hours
- Rack expenditures
- Pend data to a CSV dashboard file
- Display stored accounting records
- Search for specific entries
- Menu-driven command-line interface

Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- CSV File Handling
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)

📂 How It Works

The user inputs:
Shift worked
Total shift sales
Hours worked
Daily expenditures

The system:

Stores the data in a dashboard.csv file
Appends new records automatically
Allows the user to view stored accounting data
Enables search functionality
A menu-driven function controls user interaction and task selection.

Skills Demonstrated

- Writing modular Python functions
- Managing structured data with pandas
- File I/O operations
- Error handling with try/except
- Building interactive CLI applications
- Basic data filtering and querying

Future Improvements

Improve data validation
Add automated total daily/weekly/monthly calculations
Refactor for cleaner architecture
Implement object-oriented design
Add data visualization (e.g., sales charts)
Build a simple web interface version

Project Purpose

This project was built to strengthen the understanding of:
Backend logic structuring
Data organization
Real-world business logic implementation
Debugging and problem-solving in Python
It reflects hands-on practice in turning business requirements into functional software logic.
